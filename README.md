# Simple Blog Application

This is a simple blog web application built with **Laravel 8**. Users can register, log in, and create their own categories and articles. Unauthenticated users can view the categories and articles created by other users but cannot create or modify content.

## Features
- User authentication (registration, login, logout).
- Users can create and manage categories and articles.
- Categories are linked to the user who created them.
- Articles are linked to both a category and the user who created them.
- Unauthenticated users can browse categories and articles but cannot add or edit content.

## Project Structure
The application follows the standard Laravel structure with `Controllers`, `Models`, `Views`, and `Routes`. It uses MySQL for data storage and manages three main entities: `users`, `categories`, and `articles`.

## Database Design

### Database Tables

1. **Users**
   - Stores user information, including authentication credentials and roles.
   - Each user can create multiple categories and articles.

2. **Categories**
   - Each category is created by a user.
   - A user can have multiple categories.
   - Categories group articles based on the userâ€™s preference.

3. **Articles**
   - Each article belongs to both a category and a user.
   - Articles contain a title, content, and an associated image.

### Relationships
- **Users and Categories**: One-to-Many relationship. A user can create many categories, but each category belongs to only one user.
- **Users and Articles**: One-to-Many relationship. A user can write many articles, but each article is written by only one user.
- **Categories and Articles**: One-to-Many relationship. Each article belongs to a category, and a category can have multiple articles.

## User Roles
- **Authenticated users**: Can create, edit, and delete their own categories and articles.
- **Unauthenticated users**: Can only view categories and articles created by others.
